## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
My website features a Home page with a search bar where you can type queries like 'Silas' to get suggestions such as 'Silas Rhys Coroza.' The About page provides details on using the 4 coding fundamentals—Variable Declaration, Input/Output, Conditional Statements, and Loops—complete with its own search bar for learning and exploration.

<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project
A simple website with a Home page and an About page. The Home page has a search bar, and the About page explains four coding basics.

- Whats the purpose
To help users learn coding basics and explore how a search bar works with live suggestions.


- What are key components
Home Page: Includes a search bar that shows suggestions as you type.

About Page: Explains coding basics like variables, input/output, conditions, and loops.

- What technology used and how it is used
The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML and CSS design the site, and JavaScript makes the search bar work with suggestions.

### Key Components
<!-- TODO: List of Key Components -->

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
WD-ProjectName
└─ assets
|   └─ css
|   |   └─ style.css
|   └─ img
|   |   └─ fileWith.jpeg/.jpg/.webp/.png
